## 🔍 Overview

**FedAlign** is a lightweight, privacy-preserving framework for **Federated Domain Generalization (FedDG)** that enhances generalization to unseen domains without compromising data privacy. It addresses key challenges such as:

- Strict privacy constraints in Federated Learning (FL)
- Non-i.i.d. data distributions across clients
- Limited domain diversity

### 🚀 Key Contributions

- **Cross-Client Feature Extension Module**  
  Enhances local domain representation using domain-invariant feature perturbation and selective cross-client feature transfer.

- **Dual-Stage Alignment Module**  
  Aligns both feature embeddings and predictions across clients to extract robust, domain-invariant representations.

- **Lightweight & Scalable**  
  Requires minimal computation and communication overhead, making it suitable for real-world federated setups.
